### Key Design Decisions

1. **Rust for DSP**: All audio generation happens in Rust/WASM for maximum performance and minimal latency
2. **Nashville Number System**: Simplifies music theory for non-musicians (scale degrees instead of chord names)
3. **Pattern-Based Workflow**: Inspired by DAWs like Ableton Live and FL Studio
4. **Captured Parameters**: Recorded patterns preserve their sound settings independently from global parameters
5. **Real-Time Performance**: Zero-copy audio processing with optimized Rust code

## 🎵 Nashville Number System Explained

The **Nashville Number System** is a music notation method that uses numbers (1-7) to represent chords based on their scale degree:

| Number | Chord Type | Example in C Major |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **1 (I)** | Major | C Major |
| **2 (ii)** | Minor | D minor |
| **3 (iii)** | Minor | E minor |
| **4 (IV)** | Major | F Major |
| **5 (V)** | Major | G Major |
| **6 (vi)** | Minor | A minor |
| **7 (vii°)** | Diminished | B diminished |

**Benefits**:
- Transpose instantly by changing the key
- Universal across all musical keys
- Focus on chord relationships, not absolute pitches

---

## 🔊 Audio Performance

- **Sample Rate**: 48kHz (standard)
- **Polyphony**: 16 voices
- **Latency**: ~10-20ms (browser-dependent)
- **CPU Usage**: Optimized Rust code ensures minimal overhead
- **Audio Quality**: 32-bit float processing, PolyBLEP anti-aliasing

---

## 🛠️ Development

# Development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production

1. Create effect module in `rust-dsp/src/effects/new_effect.rs`
2. Implement processing logic
3. Expose in `rust-dsp/src/lib.rs`
4. Add TypeScript wrapper in `src/audio/WasmAudioEngine.ts`
5. Create UI controls in `src/components/EffectsPanel/EffectsPanel.tsx`

#### Adding a New Artist Preset
1. Open `src/presets/artistPresets.ts`
2. Add a new preset object with all parameters
3. The preset will automatically appear in the UI

### Understanding the Chord Suggestion Engine

The AI chord suggestion system uses a sophisticated multi-layered approach:

**1. 2nd-Order Markov Chains (70% weight)**
- Analyzes patterns like I-V-vi-IV, ii-V-I
- Considers the last 2 chords played
- Trained on thousands of popular song progressions

**2. Music Theory Rules (10% weight)**
- Circle of Fifths relationships (perfect 5th progressions)
- Functional Harmony (Tonic → Subdominant → Dominant → Tonic)
- Voice leading principles

**3. Creativity Randomization (15% weight)**
- Random boost to all chords (5-20% variation)
- Extra emphasis on adventurous choices (iii, vii°)
- Ensures suggestions are exciting and unpredictable

**4. Pattern Analysis**
- Measures predictability (how often you follow common progressions)
- Provides real-time pattern matching stats

The system provides:
- **Top 4 Suggestions** with probability percentages
- **Category Labels**: Strong, Moderate, Adventurous
- **Reason Explanations**: "Common progression", "Natural resolution", "Creative choice", etc.
- **Visual Feedback**: Highlights and animations when you match predictions
- **Compact 2x2 Grid**: Positioned between chord buttons and artist presets for easy access

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- **iOS Safari**: Requires user gesture to start audio context (tap "Start Audio Engine")
- **Audio Worklet**: Not used due to WASM import limitations; using `ScriptProcessorNode` instead
- **SharedArrayBuffer**: Not required (commented out in code)
- **Browser Compatibility**: Requires modern browser with Web Audio API v1 and WebAssembly MVP
